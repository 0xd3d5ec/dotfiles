Step one: [Installing database package]
	install "postgresql" using your package manager mostly pacman.

Step two: [Reconissance & Testing]
	test db connection after starting msf using "msfconsole" command.
	use "db_status" command to check database connectivity.
	if works great done
	if not then proceed with the next steps.

Step three: [Configuring and creating database, user with password]
	after installing postgresql, you will have another user on the system with name postgres, su into that and do the following:
	"cd ~"
	"psql -c "alter user postgres with password '<passwordhere>'"
	should see "ALTER ROLE" returned
	"psql"
	"\l" to list all databases.
	"CREATE DATABASE <databasename>;"
	"\l" to make sure database was created.
	"CREATE USER <user> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<password>';"
	"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <databasename> to <user>;"
	"exit"
	"su root"
	"cd ~"
	"mkdir .ms4"
	"cd .ms4"
	"ls"
	"vim .database.yml"
	In .database.yml file:
	[
	production:
		adapter: postgresql
		database: <database>
		username: <username>
		password: <password>
		host: <currenthostname>
		port: default is 5432, can be changed
		pool: 5
		timeout: 5
	]

Step four: [Connecting to database in msf]
	After starting msfconsole, you type db_status, still you will find no connection has been initated.
	"db_connect" should be typed to start connection using the previously created database, user, and password.
	command: "db_connect <username@database>"
	"db_status" to check database connection.
